# Drum JS
We all must have seen a drum kit in some concert or elsewhere, it is a collection of drums, cymbals and other percussion instruments.
But many of us have never played a drum, So here i created a interactive virtual drum kit on my own with the help of javaScript and a little css animation.

A **JavaScrript Drum Kit** game for playing the drum. This will give you an experience of **Playing Drums**. 

**Give it a try here:** [here](https://jitendra-codes.github.io/Drum-Js/)!
